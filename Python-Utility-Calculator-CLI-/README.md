# Command-Line Calculator

A simple Python command-line calculator that supports multiple menus and submenus for basic arithmetic operations including:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo
- Floor Division
- Handles edge cases like division by zero

## 🔁 Menu Navigation System

The program uses a looping structure with dynamic submenus. Users can navigate through different operation menus and submenus, and return to previous menus as needed. The logic ensures the menu stays active until the user exits.

- Supports chained navigation between menus
- Validates input and handles exceptions (e.g., division/modulo by 0)
- Keeps returning to submenu after a task is completed
- Clean, tested and ready-to-use code
